# Void Destroyer 2 Data Editor
A 3rd party data editor tool for modding the game Void Destroyer 2

Uses dotnet 4.0, winforms, and Ogre 1.12.1

How it works:

Data used by Void Destroyer 2 to define objects comes in the form of XML files, 
this program reads in all the possible properties of each type of object into
an object that can be viewed in a property grid control. It displays all the 
definitions that can be viewed within a tabbed tree.

Latest release does not allow for writing data back to files, but the master 
branch can, if built from source. A prebuilt release will be coming when all
features for the v0.0.4.0 release are done, hopefully very soon.

Master branch version can also display ogre meshes and use them to build a 
preview of ships.

A better readme coming soon.
