# VoidDestroyer2DataEditor
A 3rd party data editor tool for modding the game Void Destroyer 2

Uses dotnet 4.0, only standard libraries

How it works:

Data used by Void Destroyer 2 to define objects comes in the form of XML files, 
this program reads in all the possible properties of each type of object into
an object that can be viewed in a property grid control. It displays all the 
definitions that can be viewed within a tabbed tree.

It currently does not allow for writing data back to files, but will eventually do so.
